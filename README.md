# Photocatalytic-Reactor-Design
This project revolves around working with designing of a reactor in which light source is optimally used for catalysis.

## Finding different models for the photocatalytic reactor :- 
There are some models which has benen built by different researches.
For this prjecct, we need to find the different possible reactor design for photocatalytic processes.

## Current Status 
I have started this project 2 month ago under the assistant professor Dr. Ramesh Asapu, faculty member of Chemical Engineering Department. Right now, I am exploring the different articles which has been made on the topic of designing of photocatalytic reactors.

## Applications of this project :- 
Photocatalytic reactor designs are tailored for applications in environmental remediation, renewable energy, healthcare, and industrial processes. These reactors are used to treat water and air by degrading pollutants, sterilizing pathogens, and removing toxic gases. They facilitate hydrogen production through water splitting, convert COâ‚‚ into valuable fuels, and enable green chemical synthesis. In agriculture and food industries, they degrade pesticides and extend food shelf life. Advanced designs, such as LED-driven systems, solar reactors, and nanostructured catalysts, enhance efficiency and adaptability for applications like air purification, wastewater treatment, and artificial photosynthesis, making them vital for sustainable development.
