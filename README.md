# Photocatalytic-Reactor-Design
This project revolves around working with designing of a reactor in which light source is optimally used for catalysis.

## Finding different models for the photocatalytic reactor :- 
There are some models which has benen built by different researches.
For this prjecct, we need to find the different possible reactor design for photocatalytic processes.

## Current Status 
I have just started this project under the assistant professor Dr. Ramesh Asapu, faculty member of Chemical Engineering Department. Right now, I am exploring the different articles which has been made on the topic of designing of photocatalytic reactors.
